## VAE tutorial  - application to single-cell RNA-seq data


In this tutorial, we are going to delve into a class of generative models called Variational Auto-Encoders. We start by stating key statistical concepts before deriving the relevant mathematical formulation. Then we build and train a VAE. \
Finally, we are going to apply the models we built to single-cell RNA-seq data, and show how these models can be used for representation learning.

💡 This tutorial does not assume prior knowledge in variational inference or biology, but does rely on basic deep learning skills, such as building and training a feedforward neural network. AI hub students should use the `scvi-env` environment.
