    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Discriminative Learning:** \\\n",
    "Discriminative learning is a machine learning approach that focuses on learning the boundary or decision boundary that separates different classes or categories within the data. The primary goal of discriminative models is to find a function that directly maps the input data to the corresponding class labels. These models are designed to distinguish between different classes based on their distinct features or patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "A basic example of discriminative model is logistic regression, it is often used in classification tasks where the goal is to assign input data points to specific predefined categories or classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Generative Learning:**\\\n",
    "Generative learning, on the other hand, is a machine learning approach that aims to model the underlying probability distribution of the entire dataset. Instead of focusing solely on learning the decision boundary, generative models attempt to capture the inherent structure and patterns within the data. This allows them to generate new samples that resemble the original data distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "Generative models can be used for various tasks, including data synthesis, image generation, and anomaly detection. Some popular generative models include Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs), Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), and Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs).\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, discriminative learning only models the outputs given the inputs, while generative learning models the joint probability of inputs and outputs. \n",
    "\n",

    "The focus of this tutorial is on generative learning. To fit the generative models, we adopt the Bayesian inference paradigm."

    "### Bayesian modelling and Variational Inference\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose we have a probabilistic model with some parameters we want to estimate. The Bayesian paradigm involves the following key concepts:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Prior Probability:** Before observing any new data, we have an initial belief about our model parameters $\\theta$. This belief is expressed as the prior probability $p(\\theta)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Likelihood:** Given a dataset $D$, the likelihood function $L$ describes how likely the data is to occur given the underlying parameters: $L=p(D \\mid \\theta)$\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Posterior Probability:** After observing new data, the Bayesian approach updates the initial beliefs to incorporate information from this data. This process is called *Bayesian inference*. The updated parameters are represented as the posterior probability $p(\\theta \\mid D)$, which combines the prior probability and the likelihood.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Evidence:** The term $p(D)$ represents the likelihood of observing the data across all possible values of the parameters or hypotheses. It acts as a normalizing constant to ensure that the posterior probability integrates to 1. The main goal of any Bayesian count_model is to optimize the evidence for the data, which is also known as the marginal likelihood. It is often more convenient to work with the log marginal likelihood.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The posterior probability is computed via the *Bayes rule*:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ p(\\theta \\mid D) = \\frac{p(D|θ)p(θ)}{\\int p(D|θ)p(θ)dθ} = \\frac{p(D|θ)p(θ)}{p(D)}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "However, in most models, the posterior distribution is intractable because of the integral defining the evidence, which runs over the space of all $\\theta$. Therefore, the posterior must be estimated: this is called *approximate Bayesian inference*. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are a few popular approximate Bayesian inference methods, among which Markov Chain Monte Carlo (the idea is to construct a Markov chain that has the posterior distribution as its equilibrium distribution) and Variational Inference, which tries to minimize the distance between an approximate, tractable posterior (called the variational distribution) and the true one. We are going to focus on the latter. \n"

    "### Latent Variable Models\n",
    "\n",
    "Given observed data $D$, Latent Variable Models assume that the data generating process is driven by unobserved *latent variables* $Z$, of smaller dimension. The latent variables should be a summary of the data, driving its variability. They can represent a useful representation of the data. \n",

    "\n",
    "1. For each datapoint, we first sample the mixture assignment from a categorical random variable, out of $K$ possible components. \n",
    "2. Then, we sample from the assigned distribution. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this count_model, we do observe the datapoints, which were drawn conditionnally on the mixture assignment, but we do not observe the assignment itself: it is the latent variable. \n",
    "\n",
    "Given the observed data, we want to infer the latent variables, using the posterior distribution $p(Z \\mid D)$. For this purpose, we'll have to rely on approximate Bayesian inference, more precisely Variational Inference. Thus we introduce the approximate posterior $q(Z \\mid D)$, which comes from a family of tractable distributions. As we said, the goal is to minimize the distance between the true and approximate posterior. The common metric to use is the [Kullback-Leibler divergence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kullback%E2%80%93Leibler_divergence). It is defined as: \n",
